    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These butterscotch cookies are great cookies! They are made with oatmeal and love. They are perfect to share with your friends and family.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 cups rolled oats</li>
        <li>1 2/3 cups butterscotch chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Stir together flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt in a separate bowl. Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture and mix until blended. Mix in oats and butterscotch chips until combined.</li>
        <li>Drop dough by teaspoonfuls onto an un greased cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges begin to brown, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Additional tip: For those of you having trouble with the cookies being, dry, crumbly, or are having trouble removing them from the cookie sheet, it's probably because there is not enough butter in the dough. Try a full cup of butter, not 3/4 cup. For those having trouble with flat cookies, simply refrigerate your dough until it is somewhat firm.</p>
